This repository spans a variety of codes I created to handle electrophysiological and behavioral data within my masters project. They are rather specific and likely quite an eyesore for people that are great at coding. I still wanted to share them here to potentially serve as a reference or save others working with a similar setup some time. 

Within my project I utilized Neuropixels 2.0 to record electrophysiological data in mice and also quantified reaching behavior. Most of the codes either preprocess, plot or analyze associated outputs by implementing or building on other repositories such as spikeinterface and deeplabcut.
